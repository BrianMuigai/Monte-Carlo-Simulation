# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
a sample usage of Monte Carlo in simulation

**Monte-Carlo Simulation**: is a scheme employing random numbers that are 
$u(0,1)$ random variates. it is used to solve certain stochastic and deterministic problems
where the passage of time plays no role. Monte-Carlo-Simulation are 
generally static rather than dynamic.
